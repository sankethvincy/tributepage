    <b>After 1998, it was theorised that there was an orchestrated criminal <br> conspiracy surrounding the death of Diana,
        Princess
        of Wales. Official <br> investigations in both Britain and France found that Diana died in a <br> manner consistent with
        media
        reports following the fatal car crash in <br> Paris on 31 August 1997.
    </b>
    <p>But what is it actually? according to me it was a pre-planned murder executed <br> with professionals involved in it .
        And
        was'nt planned one night before but <br> had been in plan since a very long time. People with greater plans for <br>
        themselves with a vicious vision of curbing down an impeccible personality <br> with their powers at hand used for
        systematically killing a mother of two <br> children who was destined to be what we could not imagine
    </p>
    <p> They were so afraid of her getting fame and wealth on top earning the love of <br> every individual in britain. It is
        said that wherever Diana stayed hundreds of <br> journalists and photographers used to gather within seconds of the <br>
        information spreading. And we cannot leave the fact of her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>Active in disputing the official version of events have been the British <br> newspaper Daily Express and Egyptian
        businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, <br> whose son, Dodi, was Diana's boyfriend at the time and died with her in the <br> crash.
        In
        2003, Diana's butler Paul Burrell published a note that he claimed <br> had been written by Diana in 1995, in which
        there
        were allegations that her <br> former husband was "planning 'an accident' in [Diana's] car, brake failure and <br> serious
        head injury" so that he could marry again. A special Metropolitan <br> Police inquiry team was established in
        2004, Operation Paget, headed by <br> Commissioner John Stevens to investigate the various conspiracy theories <br> which
        led
        up to the British inquest. This investigation looked into 175 <br> conspiracy claims that had been made by Fayed.[11]
        Among the witnesses <br> questioned was Prince Charles, who in 2005 told Stevens that he did not <br> know about his
        former
        wife's note from 1995 and could not understand why <br> she had these feelings. Fayed has persistently propounded
        what were found to <br> be conspiracy theories at the inquest and has repeatedly claimed that he <br> believes his son
        was murdered with Diana</p>
